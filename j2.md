1- Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
 - string s is an object
2 -(A) What is a static method in Java?
 - Use the class name when calling a static method.
  (B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?
3- What is the output of the following programs?
   program 1 - incorrect since == compares the object program's memory locations
   program 2 - correct since it compares the character and enters the address
4- Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
    - It just modifies the address of str; it doesn't alter the season because it calls the change_season method using the season's memory location.
5- What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
  - X:0 Y:0 since the original memory address of str is not altered by the point method
6 - What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
    - The principle of information hiding is maintained by the private declaration, which restricts the visibility of variables and functions.
7 - In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
   - Java uses their arguments to select one of the two constructors.
8 - For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
   - option 4 would achieve this
       - the point of inheritence is code reuse
       - option 1 & 2 are out out because x & y are private
       - option 3 is not allowed
       - option 4 declares the new x & y and calls a public so it works
       - option 5 does not declare x&y
9 - If we add this constructor to CustomPoint:
    - x:10 y:10
    - It must be their first line if you want to label them super; otherwise, it won't combine.
10 - What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
    x:0 y:0
11 - If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)
      - option 2 is valid
      - option 1 does not work because x &y are private
      - option 2 is the one that is valid
      - option 3 & 4 do not work
12 - What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
      - A function can be accessed within the class and any derived classes thanks to the protected modifier.
